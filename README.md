# Machine Learning for Beginners

Welcome to the 'Machine Learning for Beginners' repository. This repository is designed to help those new to machine learning get a grasp of basic concepts and methods in the field. The methods are implemented from scratch and also using libraries like scikit-learn.

## Contents

This repository contains simple sheets and implementations of basic machine learning concepts and methods such as:

- **Regressions and its forms**: Understand the basics of regression analysis and its various forms like linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression.

- **Decision Trees**: Learn how decision trees work and how they can be used for both regression and classification tasks.

- **Ensemble Learning**: Get to know ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking, and how they can improve the performance of machine learning models.

- **Clustering**: Discover the world of unsupervised learning with clustering techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Understand the simplicity and effectiveness of the KNN algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Learn about SVMs and how they can be used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.

## Usage

Each concept and method comes with its own dedicated folder containing a simple sheet explaining the concept and Python scripts showing how the method can be implemented both from scratch and using scikit-learn.
